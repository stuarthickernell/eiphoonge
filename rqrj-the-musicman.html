I am getting a new guitar for college and want to know how sharp the frets are on these. I have noticed a good number of guitars in this price range still have frets that cut up your fingers when you do slides as if they are 0 acoustics. Does anyone have experience with these and can tell me whether or not this is the case? Thanks in advance! TL;DR: Do the frets on the musicman jp70, jp150, and JP Signatures cut up your fingers when doing slides or are they smooth.

I am building my own bass guitar from parts and once I chose what pickups to use I got stuck. The pickups I decided upon are quite the oddity in the world of guitars as they are of relatively low impedance (nearly a tenth that of an ordinary pickup) and therefore in need of preamplification to match the impedance and output required for ideal operation with amplifiers. Since using on-board preamps has been commonplace in the world of bass guitar for several decades I first looked Amazon.com: The Music Man (1962): Robert Preston, Shirley Jones, Buddy Hackett, Hermione Gingold, Paul Ford, Ron Howard, Pert Kelton, Timmy Everett, Susan Luckey, Harry Hickox, Charles Lane, Mary Wickes, Morton DaCosta: Movies.

When I first started getting into the bass, I asked a friend who had played for years what my first instrument should be. He recommended a Musicman SUB Ray4, which I ran out and bought immediately; I was super excited to get playing. I didn't know much about the bass, so I plug it in, and I get this HORRIBLE buzz. I thought this was just part of the active pickup, so i tweaked the knobs a bit and got it playable.
